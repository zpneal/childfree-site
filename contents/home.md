Childfree adults (1) do not have biological or adopted children _and_ (2) do not want to have biological or adopted children. A person can be childfree whether they are capable of having children or not; their fertility is irrelevant.

Childfree adults are sometimes also called voluntarily childless. However, we prefer the term "childfree" for a few reasons. First, it is the most widely-used term in academic and non-academic circles. Second, it is a short, single-word term that is easy to use in writing. Third, it is the term preferred by members of this group.

### Types of non-parents
Demographic research often distinguishes parents from non-parents, but there are many different types of non-parents. Different types of non-parents can be distinguished by their Attitudes, Behaviors, and Circumstances surrounding having children, or what we call [the ABC Framework](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fa89m):

* _Childfree_ adults do not want children

* _Undecided_ adults do not know if they want children, but could have them

* _Ambivalent_ adults do not know if they wanted children, and cannot have them

* _Not yet parents_ want children, and can have them

* _Childless_ adults wanted children, but cannot have them for biological or social reasons


### Why study childfree adults?
Although there are [magazine articles](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2148636,00.html), [books](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524744093), and [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/) about the childfree, it remains an understudied population. We think there are several reasons to study childfree adults. First, childfree adults make up a [large and growing part of the total population](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.13097), with estimates ranging between 10 and 20%. Second, childfree adults have [unique reproductive health needs](https://share.upmc.com/2023/12/child-free-choice/), and specifically need access to high-quality methods of birth control or to surgical sterilization. Third, childfree adults have [unique financial planning needs](https://childfreewealth.com/), including planning for a retirement and end-of-life expenses without leaving an estate. Fourth, childfree adults are often subject to false stereotypes (e.g., they're selfish), stigmas (because having children is normative), and [extra demands at work](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/--whats-like-childfree-work--2022-study-) (because they don't have children) that can reduce their quality of life.
